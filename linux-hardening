# Considerations when hardening a linux system

## Principle of least privilege

## Avoid running processes as root when not needed

## Single User mode attack vector mitigation

1. Make sure booting into single user requires sulogin not sushell
  - for systemd systems edit:
  ```
  > /lib/systemd/system/emergency.service && /lib/systemd/system/rescue.service
  ```

2. Also make sure that editing grub has a password to prevent changing initto bypass sulogin
  - generate encrypted password for grub
  ```
  > grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
  ```
  - edit /etc/grub/40-custom
  ```
  > set superusers="root"
  > password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.58F...hash...B88CC0EB4
  ```
  - regenerate grub configs
  ```
  > update-grub && update-grub2
  ```
